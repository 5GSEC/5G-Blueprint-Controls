### Severity
High


### Description of the the issue

OAI workloads have sensitive assets that are not protected at run time, hence an attacker compromise the workload if they get access to it.

### What does this control test

This control checks whether there are only kubearmor policies enforced for the sensiitive assets mapped to a particular workload (given by the user using: https://github.com/5GSEC/regolibrary/blob/test/oaiMapping/workloadConfig.yaml )

### Remediation

Use Least permissive Kubearmor Policies to protect these sensitive assets. Guide: https://docs.kubearmor.io/kubearmor/use-cases/least_permissive_access
